	This is the template do-file for Patrick Blanchenay's 
	ECO372 Assignment 1. Before anything else, rename this file, 
	changing "SURNAME" to your ACORN surname, and "Firstname" to 
	your ACORN first name. Use _ for spaces.
	
	For me, it would be: ECO372_Assignment1_BLANCHENAY_Patrick.do

	Comment your code, explain what steps you are doing. 
	You can insert comments before the instruction, or at the 
	end of lines.
	
	You should also use indentation to make your code easy to read.
	
	Remember that running this do-file does not save it.
